# BattleshipV2
A redesign of my original Battleship game
	A redesign of my original Battleship Game The first version was an attempt that I made befoe I started my program in 
  Microsoft Software and Systems Academy at the time I just started really understanding how object oriented programming works.
	
## Changes
This game has a total redesign, I decided this game would be more intuitive to build the game board with the use of multi-dimensional arrays. 
The multi-dimensional array will also allow the game to function around it.
